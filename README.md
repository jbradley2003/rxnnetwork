In this project, we aimed to find the most efficient reaction pathway via a reaction network approach.

So far, we have tested two reactions:
-  $2\text{I}\text{Cl} + \text{H}_2 → 2\text{HCl} + \text{I}_2$
- $\text{C}_2\text{H}_4 + \text{O}_3 → 
\text{CH}_2\text{O} + \text{CH}_2\text{OO}$ 


## Background
Modern quantum chemical methods of finding the most efficient reaction pathway are very computationally expensive and often do not consider all the possible reactive intermediates. A network based approach can be much more computationally efficient and accounts for all the possible reactive intermediates.

## The Reaction Network
Based on the Paper: [Efficient prediction of reaction paths through molecular graph and reaction
